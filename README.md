# Text-classification-with-are-k-Nearest-neighbors-Neural-Network-MLP-and-Naive-Bayes

The Chosen classification models for this project are k Nearest neighbors, Neural Network(MLP) and Naive Bayes. The chosen datasets are SMS spam and IMDB movie review datasets. The evaluation method used in this project is Grid search. The Grid Search allowed the researcher to identify the best parameters successfully. The results suggested that for this two datasets ANN(MLP) performed better than KNN and Naïve Bays. The finding of this report also suggests that with the advancement of AI the importance of ethics and explainability of AI based systems are undeniable.
